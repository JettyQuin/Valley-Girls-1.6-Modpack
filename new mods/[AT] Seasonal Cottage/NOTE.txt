I want to say thank you to Yri for making this cottage for me and I want to thank Dodo for pointing me in the right direction in how to turn the houses into Alternate Textures.

Oh. Here is also a transparent of the blanket, pillow if you're wanting to add it to other seasons or change the color. <3


Thank you.
