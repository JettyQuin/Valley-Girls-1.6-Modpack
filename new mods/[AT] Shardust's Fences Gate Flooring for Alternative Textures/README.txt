A port of my Content Patcher's Fences Gate Flooring mod for Alternative Textures.

Some CP options were omitted due to AT's own framework limitations. Also due to said limitations, there is only one Gate texture and one Hedge texture (same one for each of the fences) in the main folder, the others are in a separate file to be also installed in the mods folder (if you want them, of course).

The objects that were retextured and/or recolored are:
Wood Fence, Stone Fence, Iron Fence, Hardwood Fence, Wood Floor, Rustic Plank Floor, Straw Floor, Weathered Floor, Crystal Floor, Stone Floor, Stone Walkway Floor, Brick Floor, Wood Path, Gravel Path, Cobblestone Path, Stepping Stone Path, Crystal Path, Gate (1-4 retextures), Hedges (1-4 retextures, can be applied to all 4 fence type at the same time)

The colors available for each item are:
Amethyst, Aquamarine, Ash, Blackberry, Coal, Cocoa, Cream, Diamond, Emerald, Honey, Mahogany, Mocha, Oak, Olive, Ruby, Rust, Saffron, Sapphire, Spinel, Steel, Topaz, Umber, Walnut, Wine.

Thank you for checking out my mods!
