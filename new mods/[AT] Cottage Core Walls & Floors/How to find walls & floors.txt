Purchase the Alternative Textures "Paint Bucket" tool from Robin's shop.

To use the Paint Bucket, click on a wall or floor in the farmhouse to bring up a menu of all available textures. This includes the default textures (from the vanilla game or any Content Patcher mods you have installed) followed by walls or floors from any AT mods you have installed.

You can use the search field to search by keyword.

Search for "Cottage Core" (or Cottagecore) to see all walls or floors from this mod.

SEARCH BY MATERIAL OR PATTERN:
